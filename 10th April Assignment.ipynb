    "## Q1. A company conducted a survey of its employees and found that 70% of the employees use the company's health insurance plan, while 40% of the employees who use the plan are smokers. What is the probability that an employee is a smoker given that he/she uses the health insurance plan?\n",

    "- S: Event that an employee is a smoker\n",
    "- H: Event that an employee uses the health insurance plan\n",

    "We are given the following information:\n",
    "- P(H) = 0.70, which is the probability that an employee uses the health insurance plan (prior probability).\n",

    "## Q2. What is the difference between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes are two variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm that are commonly used for classification tasks. The main difference between them lies in the type of features they can handle and the underlying probability distributions they assume.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bernoulli Naive Bayes:\n",
    "   - Suitable for binary or boolean features.\n",
    "   - Assumes that each feature follows a Bernoulli distribution, which means that it can take one of two values: 0 or 1 (absent or present).\n",
    "   - Often used in text classification tasks, where the features represent the presence or absence of specific words in a document.\n",
    "   - The probability calculations in Bernoulli Naive Bayes involve counting the occurrences of each feature value in each class and computing probabilities based on those counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multinomial Naive Bayes:\n",
    "   - Suitable for discrete or count-based features.\n",
    "   - Assumes that each feature follows a multinomial distribution, which means it can take multiple discrete values (e.g., word counts or frequencies).\n",
    "   - Widely used in text classification tasks, where the features represent word counts, term frequencies, or other discrete features.\n",
    "   - The probability calculations in Multinomial Naive Bayes involve counting the occurrences of each feature value in each class and computing probabilities based on those counts. It typically involves smoothing techniques, such as Laplace smoothing or add-one smoothing, to handle zero-count issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the key distinction between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes lies in the type of features they can handle and the probability distributions they assume. Bernoulli Naive Bayes is suitable for binary features, assuming a Bernoulli distribution, while Multinomial Naive Bayes is designed for discrete or count-based features, assuming a multinomial distribution. The choice between the two depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem at hand."

    "## Q3. How does Bernoulli Naive Bayes handle missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes assumes binary features where each feature can take one of two values: 0 or 1, representing absence or presence, respectively. When dealing with missing values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes, there are a few common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ignoring the Missing Values:\n",
    "   One option is to simply ignore instances with missing values during training and testing. This means that any instance with missing values will be excluded from the calculations and not used to update probabilities. However, this approach can lead to a loss of information and potentially biased results if the missing values are not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Missing Values as a Separate Category:\n",
    "   Another approach is to treat missing values as a separate category or a third value, distinct from 0 and 1. This allows the algorithm to consider the absence of a feature value as meaningful information. In this case, the missing values are treated as a distinct category during probability calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Imputation:\n",
    "   Imputation involves filling in the missing values with estimates or predictions. For Bernoulli Naive Bayes, imputation methods could involve assigning either 0 or 1 to the missing values based on some criteria or using more sophisticated techniques such as expectation maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the missing values based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of how to handle missing values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes depends on the specifics of the dataset, the nature of the missing values, and the goals of the analysis. It is important to consider the potential impact of missing values on the accuracy and reliability of the results and choose an approach that is most appropriate for the given scenario."

    "## Q4. Can Gaussian Naive Bayes be used for multi-class classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Gaussian Naive Bayes can be used for multi-class classification tasks. Gaussian Naive Bayes is an extension of the Naive Bayes algorithm that assumes a Gaussian (normal) distribution for the continuous features in the data. While it is commonly used for binary classification problems, it can be adapted to handle multi-class classification as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of multi-class classification, Gaussian Naive Bayes models the probability distributions of each class's features as Gaussian distributions. It calculates the likelihood of a particular feature value belonging to each class using the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution associated with that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training phase, Gaussian Naive Bayes estimates the mean and variance for each class's feature values based on the training data. Then, during the prediction phase, it uses these estimated parameters to calculate the likelihoods of the feature values given each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify a new instance with multiple features, Gaussian Naive Bayes calculates the likelihoods for each class based on the Gaussian distributions, multiplies them by the prior probabilities of the classes, and normalizes the probabilities to obtain the posterior probabilities. The class with the highest posterior probability is predicted as the class label for the new instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while Gaussian Naive Bayes can handle multi-class classification, it assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label, which may not hold true in all cases. Thus, the performance of Gaussian Naive Bayes can be influenced by the presence of strong dependencies or correlations between features."
